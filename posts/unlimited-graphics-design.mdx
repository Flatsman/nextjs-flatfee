 ## let’s look at some of the pros and cons of the typical options for graphic design:
You have several options to fulfill your design needs – hiring freelancers, hiring an agency that can help you, in-house employees and using an unlimited graphic design service.

### Freelancers 
Working with freelancers can come with a lot of perks. For instance, if you just need a one off task completed and have a vetted list of freelancers that you can work with, your design process will be pretty straightforward.

### Design Agencies 
When you thoroughly vet and hire a design agency you will be able to count on consistency, accountability and high standards. You will also have an agreed upon turnaround time and maybe even rush service options. And a price tag to take this into account. But chances are that price tag won’t involve a flat fee. If you need to customize what you need on a monthly basis, you may incur a lot of additional charges.

### In-House Designers 
With an in-house designer, you will have the advantage of getting work on time, consistency, and the ability to supervise and work closely with your team members. Before making this investment though, it’s important to evaluate your business’ unique needs. For many small and medium-sized, or bootstrapped business’ this is simply not an option.
